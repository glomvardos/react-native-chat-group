## Overview

I used React Native and NestJS to create this project. This project is a chat group application which you can create a room and chat with other people who are also members of the room.

- You can register/login
- You can create/delete a room
- You can join/leave a room
- You can kick other members from the room if you are the room owner
- You can delete/edit your messages
- You can delete your account
- You can search for other rooms to join
